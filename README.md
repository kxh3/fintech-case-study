  - When Joe Stein first got a finance job, he realized that finance consisted of "making rich people richer" while there was a lack of service for those less
fortunate. When the 2008 crisis happened, Joe realized that a lot of people were struggling and needed desperate help. Joe saw that there needed to be an expansion in wealth building services to a wider range of customers. Then the idea of building a robo advising company came along.

## Business Activities:

  - The specific financial problem the company is trying to solve is that not enough of the population is recieving the financial advisement needed to help them. In person     advisement only reached a certain number of customers, meanwhile robo advising can reach a larger range. Also at the time this company was founded, the population was struggling due to the 2008 crisis and Betterment's goal was to help the population recover. Their goal is to advise customers on where to invest, how to save money, track finances, etc.

Betterment offers trade commission fees from 0.25-0.40%, access to human advisors, and retirement account options. The most common offer among these companies are low fees, but the retirement options offer make Betterment stand out from its competitors.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
  - Major trends of robo advising was offering customers quick, convenient, and low cost financial advice since going in person was more time consuming and costly. These robo advising companies have been constantly working to compete against banks since they offer low fees and higher interests rates. Major innovations inlcude tools where customers can automatically save money and budget.

  - Other major companies in this domain are Wealthfront, SoFi, and Personal Capital.

  - The businees impact of this company so far is that it has provided customers (who are lost in where to invest or how to save their money) great financial advice. It has especially impacted the employers who do not have retirement plans for their employees because they seem to be too time consuming and expensive. Thanks to Betterment, they were able to guide these employers into creating retirement plans, specifically 401k plans, that can help benefit their employees.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
  - I would suggest they could offer more advice and services relating to cryptocurrency since it is not often seen. Betterment could add an additional portfolio that tracks how the customer spends their cryptocurrency and where they can invest it. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
  - I think this would benefit the company because it is not seen done before based on the other companies I have check and it would make Betterment stand out. Although cryptocurrency has been around for awhile, it has not gain the attention that it has today and more of the population is getting invovled. A number of people are jumping into investing in cryptocurrency based on the hype instead of looking for professional advice that they could benefit from more. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  - Additional technology that this service would utilize is the technology that would allow users to connect their crypto wallets onto the Betterment website. This will allow users to view the crypotcurrency that they bought in other wallets onto the Betterment website where they can track or invest it. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  - I believe these technologies are appropriate for my solution because Betterment currently does not offer options where you can view your crypotcurrency portfolios. Therefore adding the technology that allows you to connect your crypto wallet to Betterment is neccessary. Especially because you can not buy cryptocurrency on Betterment since that is not the goal of their website.
